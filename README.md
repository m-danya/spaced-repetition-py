## Advantages

- It stores data in straight-line JSON format
- The `cards.json` file can be stored anywhere (you can configure it in the Settings). For example, you can use Dropbox to sync your cards across the devices

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-danya/spaced-repetition-py
pip install .
```

## Running

spaced-repetition
```

## Todo
- changing and deleting words option
- "added words today" counter
- back-to-front asking mode
